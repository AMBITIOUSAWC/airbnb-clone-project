# StayBackend: The Airbnb Clone Project Blueprint

## About the Project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It focuses on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project guides learners through building a scalable web application while understanding complex architectures and collaborative team dynamics.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, learners will:

- Master collaborative workflows using GitHub.
- Deepen understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
- Implement advanced API security measures.
- Design and manage CI/CD pipelines for streamlined deployment.
- Strengthen project planning and documentation skills.
- Integrate technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL effectively.

## Requirements

To complete the project, participants must:

- Have a GitHub account to manage repositories.
- Understand Markdown syntax.
- Be familiar with Django and MySQL.
- Understand software development lifecycle practices (e.g. security, CI/CD).
- Be comfortable using tools like Docker and GitHub Actions.

## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**: Implements server-side logic, API routes, and business logic using Django.
- **Database Administrator**: Designs and maintains relational databases, ensuring data integrity.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Sets up CI/CD pipelines and manages containerization tools like Docker.
- **Security Engineer**: Ensures data protection through authentication, authorization, and encryption methods.
- **Project Manager**: Coordinates team tasks, timelines, and milestones for efficient collaboration.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: Web framework used to build RESTful APIs.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing and managing application data.
- **GraphQL**: API query language offering flexible data retrieval.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for consistent environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation tool for streamlined deployments.

## Database Design

**Entities & Sample Fields**

- **User**
  - id, username, email, password, joined_at
- **Property**
  - id, name, location, host_id, price
- **Booking**
  - id, user_id, property_id, check_in, check_out
- **Review**
  - id, booking_id, rating, comment, created_at
- **Payment**
  - id, booking_id, amount, status, payment_date

**Relationships**

- A **User** can host multiple **Properties**.
- A **Booking** links a **User** to a **Property**.
- A **Review** is associated with a **Booking**.
- A **Payment** is tied to a **Booking** for financial transactions.
## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**: Allows users to sign up, log in, update profiles, and manage listings.
- **Property Management**: Hosts can add, update, and remove property listings with availability and pricing.
- **Booking System**: Users can search for properties, check availability, and make reservations.
- **Review System**: After a stay, users can leave feedback with ratings and comments.
- **Payment Gateway**: Securely processes user transactions for bookings using integrated payment APIs.

## API Security

Key measures implemented:

- **Authentication**: Ensures only registered users can access restricted endpoints.
- **Authorization**: Grants access based on user roles (e.g., admin, host, guest).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting request frequency.

**Importance**:

- Protects sensitive user data.
- Prevents unauthorized access to property or booking info.
- Safeguards financial transactions from fraud.


## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates testing and deployment to improve efficiency and reduce errors.

**Tools Used**:

- **GitHub Actions**: Triggers builds/tests on each code commit.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistency across development and production.
- **Shell Scripts/YAML**: Used to define pipeline tasks for builds, tests, and deployment.
